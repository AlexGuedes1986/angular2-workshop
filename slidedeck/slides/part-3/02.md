## Dependency Injection

* If a service is injected into a component it must first be provided
* If a service is provided to a component, it is available to that component's children
    * In practice, this means you can provide a service to a root component and it becomes available all down the tree
* Anytime you provide a service, it is instantiated
    * Be aware of this if sharing state in a service
